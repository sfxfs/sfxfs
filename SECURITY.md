## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in any of my projects, please report it responsibly.

Instead, please:
1. **Email**: Send details to [security contact - update with actual email]
2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### 🔒 What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: I will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Initial Response**: I will provide an initial response within 5 business days
- **Updates**: I will keep you informed of progress
- **Resolution**: I will work to resolve confirmed vulnerabilities promptly

### 🏆 Recognition

If you responsibly disclose a security vulnerability:
- I will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- I appreciate your help in keeping the projects secure

### ⚠️ Scope

This policy applies to:
- All public repositories under my GitHub account
- Any security issues in the code, dependencies, or documentation

### 🚫 Out of Scope
