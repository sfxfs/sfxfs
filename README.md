### 👨‍💻 Statement

Hi! I'm currently studying Software Engineering at the National University of Singapore. I was previously a member of the Underwater Intelligence Innovation Laboratory at Jimei University. My focus is on embedded system software development, and I've been responsible for the development of underwater unmanned submersibles (underwater drones) using Linux and RTOS. While I'm primarily skilled in C, I also use other languages like C++ and Python.
